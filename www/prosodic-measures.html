            What do the Voxit prosodic measures quantify?
          </h3>

          <p id="WPM">
            <b>Words Per Minute</b><br />
            The average number of words per minute. The transcript of the
            recording created by Gentle, corrected when necessary, produced the
            number of words read, which was divided by the length of the
            recording and normalized, if the recording was longer or shorter
            than one minute, to reflect the speaking rate for 60 seconds.
          </p>
          <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_(hz)">
            <b>f0 Mean</b><br />
            Average Pitch. Mean f0, or the fundamental frequency, of a voice is
            sampled every 10 milliseconds, measured in Hertz (cycles per
            second), excluding outliers. This actually measures the number of
            times the vocal cords vibrate per second.
          </p>
          <p id="Drift_f0_Range_(octaves)">
            <b>f0 Range</b><br />
            Range of pitches measured in octaves, excluding outliers.
          </p>
          <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_Abs_Velocity_(octaves/sec)">
            <b>f0 Mean Absolute Velocity</b><br />
            Speed of f0 in octaves per second. This is simply a measure of how
            fast pitch is changing. While we calculate this with attention to
            direction of pitch speed, or velocity—that is, whether pitch is
            typically rising or falling, which can indicate a questioning,
            leading, or tentative tone, versus an authoritative, declarative or
            conclusive tone—we remove the +/- sign to compare the absolute value
            of the pitch speed among speakers.
          </p>
          <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_Abs_Accel_(octaves/sec^2)">
            <b>f0 Mean Absolute Acceleration</b><br />
            Acceleration of f0 in octaves per second squared. Acceleration is
            the rate of change of pitch velocity, that is how rapidly the
            changes in pitch change, which we perceive as the lilt of a voice.
            Again, while we calculate the rate of change in speed with attention
            to direction—that is, whether pitch change is typically curving
            upward or curving downward —we compare pitch acceleration among
            speakers without regard to direction. This is also a very useful
            measure for expressivity.
          </p>
          <p id="Drift_f0_Entropy">
            <b>f0 Entropy</b><br />
            or entropy for f0, indicating the predictability of pitch patterns.
            Entropy is an information theoretic measure of predictability (or
            strictly speaking, its opposite – unpredictability or disorder).
            Mathematically, if P(f) is the probability that a given talker uses
            a particular pitch frequency f, then entropy is given by the
            negative of the sum of all pitch probabilities times the log (base
            2) of those pitch probabilities -
            <img src="entropy-equation.svg" alt="entropy equation" />. In this
            case, entropy quantifies how uniformly a speaker uses all possible
            pitches within +/-1 octave of their mean—that is, how much of the
            available pitch values the speaker uses. Staying narrowly close to
            the mean most of the time (even with high f0speed) gives low
            entropy. Using all pitches with equal probability gives high
            entropy.
          </p>
          <p id="Gentle_Complexity_All_Pauses">
            <b>Rhythmic Complexity All Pauses</b><br />
            This measure is unitless, calculated using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm
            to estimate Kolomogorov complexity, also used for compression, as
            with gif or zip files. A higher value indicates less predictable &
            less repetitive pauses, normalized for audio length. The idea is to
            find any and all repeated temporal patterns, counting speech and
            moments of pause vs. speech or voiced vs. unvoiced as 1's and 0's
            respectively over time. For pause complexity we used pause (1) vs.
            speech (0). This measure reflects how many unique speech-pause
            patterns are required to combine in order to reproduce the observed
            speech-pause signal. The more easily one can reconstruct the data
            with a set of repeated patterns, the simpler it is, i.e. lower
            rhythmic complexity, or more predictable, regular rhythm. As a
            generalization, the more predictable a poet’s rhythmic measures, the
            more formally they may read, while the less predictable, the more
            conversationally they may read.
          </p>
          <p id="Gentle_Pause_Rate_(pause/sec)">
            <b>Average Pause Rate</b><br />
            Average number of pauses greater than 100, 250 and 500 ms,
            normalized for recording length.
          </p>
          <p id="Gentle_Mean_Pause_Duration_(sec)">
            <b>Average Pause Duration</b><br />
            Average length of pauses
          </p>
          <p id="Gentle_Pause_Count">
            <b>Pause Count</b><br />
            The number of pauses between words greater than 100, 500, 1000, and
            2000 milliseconds, per minute, normalized for recording length. We
            do not consider pauses less than 100ms because fully continuous
            speech also naturally has such brief gaps in energy, nor do we
            consider pauses that exceed 1,999 ms (that is, 2 seconds), because
            they are quite rare within the reading of a poem.

          <h3 id="full-vs-selection">Full Recording Duration vs. Selection</h3>
          <p>
            Drift calculates prosodic measurements for both a selected timeframe
            and a “full recording duration”. A full recording duration is
            <b>not</b>
            defined as the duration of the full audio file, but the duration
            between when Gentle aligns the first word of the transcript and the
            last word of the transcript to the audio file. For example, given a
            long audio clip with a short transcript, “full recording duration”
            refers only to the period between the first word and the last word
            of the transcript corresponding to the audio clip. However, you can
            make a selection outside a transcript duration and Drift will
            calculate Voxit prosodic measurements for that full selection
            duration, regardless whether a transcript is found in the selection.
