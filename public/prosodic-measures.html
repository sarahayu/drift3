          What do the Voxit prosodic measures quantify?
        </h3>

        <p>
          *These measures work best for 20 second windows of audio. Rigorous testing shows that a window/audio sample of
          20 seconds is ideal for its consistency in matching the prosodic measures of the entire audio length, thus
          downloading <a href="#windowed-voxit-data" class="discreet-link">windowed data</a> will also default to
          20-second window lengths.
        </p>
        <p>To learn more about the prosodic measures and how much they might differ for a given group of recordings, see

        <p id="WPM">
          <b>Words Per Minute</b><br />
          The average number of words per minute. The transcript of the
          recording created by Gentle, corrected when necessary, produced the
          number of words read, which was divided by the length of the
          recording and normalized, if the recording was longer or shorter
          than one minute, to reflect the speaking rate for 60 seconds.
        </p>
        <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_(hz)">
          <b>f0 Mean</b><br />
          Average Pitch. Mean f0, or the fundamental frequency, of a voice is
          sampled every 10 milliseconds, measured in Hertz (cycles per
          second), excluding outliers. This actually measures the number of
          times the vocal cords vibrate per second.
        </p>
        <p id="Drift_f0_Range_(octaves)">
          <b>f0 Range</b><br />
          Range of pitches measured in octaves, excluding outliers.
        </p>
        <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_Abs_Velocity_(octaves/sec)">
          <b>f0 Mean Absolute Velocity</b><br />
          Speed of f0 in octaves per second. This is simply a measure of how
          fast pitch is changing. While we calculate this with attention to
          direction of pitch speed, or velocity—that is, whether pitch is
          typically rising or falling, which can indicate a questioning,
          leading, or tentative tone, versus an authoritative, declarative or
          conclusive tone—we remove the +/- sign to compare the absolute value
          of the pitch speed among speakers.
        </p>
        <p id="Drift_f0_Mean_Abs_Accel_(octaves/sec^2)">
          <b>f0 Mean Absolute Acceleration</b><br />
          Acceleration of f0 in octaves per second squared. Acceleration is
          the rate of change of pitch velocity, that is how rapidly the
          changes in pitch change, which we perceive as the lilt of a voice.
          Again, while we calculate the rate of change in speed with attention
          to direction—that is, whether pitch change is typically curving
          upward or curving downward —we compare pitch acceleration among
          speakers without regard to direction. This is also a very useful
          measure for expressivity.
        </p>
        <p id="Drift_f0_Entropy">
          <b>f0 Entropy</b><br />
          or entropy for f0, indicating the predictability of pitch patterns.
          Entropy is an information theoretic measure of predictability (or
          strictly speaking, its opposite – unpredictability or disorder).
          Mathematically, if P(f) is the probability that a given talker uses
          a particular pitch frequency f, then entropy is given by the
          negative of the sum of all pitch probabilities times the log (base
          2) of those pitch probabilities -
          <img src="entropy-equation.svg" alt="entropy equation" />. In this
          case, entropy quantifies how uniformly a speaker uses all possible
          pitches within +/-1 octave of their mean—that is, how much of the
          available pitch values the speaker uses. Staying narrowly close to
          the mean most of the time (even with high f0speed) gives low
          entropy. Using all pitches with equal probability gives high
          entropy.
        </p>
        <p id="Gentle_Complexity_All_Pauses">
          <b>Rhythmic Complexity All Pauses</b><br />
          This measure is unitless, calculated using the Lempel-Ziv algorithm
          to estimate Kolomogorov complexity, also used for compression, as
          with gif or zip files. A higher value indicates less predictable &
          less repetitive pauses, normalized for audio length. The idea is to
          find any and all repeated temporal patterns, counting speech and
          moments of pause vs. speech or voiced vs. unvoiced as 1's and 0's
          respectively over time. For pause complexity we used pause (1) vs.
          speech (0). This measure reflects how many unique speech-pause
          patterns are required to combine in order to reproduce the observed
          speech-pause signal. The more easily one can reconstruct the data
          with a set of repeated patterns, the simpler it is, i.e. lower
          rhythmic complexity, or more predictable, regular rhythm. As a
          generalization, the more predictable a poet’s rhythmic measures, the
          more formally they may read, while the less predictable, the more
          conversationally they may read.
        </p>
        <p id="Gentle_Pause_Rate_(pause/sec)">
          <b>Average Pause Rate</b><br />
          Average number of pauses greater than 100, 250 and 500 ms,
          normalized for recording length.
        </p>
        <p id="Gentle_Mean_Pause_Duration_(sec)">
          <b>Average Pause Duration</b><br />
          Average length of pauses
        </p>
        <p id="Gentle_Pause_Count">
          <b>Pause Count</b><br />
          The number of pauses between words greater than 100, 500, 1000, and
          2000 milliseconds, per minute, normalized for recording length. We
          do not consider pauses less than 100ms because fully continuous
          speech also naturally has such brief gaps in energy, nor do we
          consider pauses that exceed 1,999 ms (that is, 2 seconds), because
          they are quite rare within the reading of a poem.

        <p id="Intensity_Mean_Abs_Velocity_(decibels/sec)">
          <b class="m-right-1">Intensity Mean Absolute Velocity</b><span class="platform"
            title="This feature is only available on the downloadable MAC DMG">DMG</span><br />
          Average speed of change of intensity/volume. Sound intensity or volume is measured in decibels (dB), a
          logarithmic unit of power that correlates with our subjective impression of loudness. Intensity Speed measures
          how rapidly a talker modulates the volume of her/his voice within each voiced segment (which may include part
          of a word, one entire word, or several words in close succession). For example an even utterance “hel-lo”
          would have low Intensity Speed, whereas a sudden stress on the end “hel-LO” or the beginning “HEL-lo” would
          have high Intensity speed. The unit of measurement is decibels-per-second or dB/s.

        <p id="Dynamism">
          <b class="m-right-1">Dynamism</b><span class="platform"
            title="This feature is only available on the downloadable MAC DMG">DMG</span><br />
          This is a composite measure, multiplying average pitch speed by average pitch entropy, and adding the average
          of syllabic and phrasal rhythmic complexity, with the terms weighted to have equal influence (dynamism =
          (abs(f0speed) * f0entropy) + (complexitySyllables+complexityPhrases)*.2195. This is a measure-in-progress, an
          attempt to put on a number on how predictable or repetitive a speaker’s pitch, or intonation, and rhythmic
          patterns are in combination. We note that a predictable rhythmic pattern may be characteristic of more formal
          poetry that uses repetition and anaphora when the poet emphasizes those patterns vocally, while pitch and
          intonation patterns would seem to be more independent of poetic form.

        <h3 id="full-vs-selection">Full Recording Duration vs. Selection</h3>
        <p>
          Drift calculates prosodic measurements for both a selected timeframe
          and a “full recording duration”. A full recording duration is
          <b>not</b>
          defined as the duration of the full audio file, but the duration
          between when Gentle aligns the first word of the transcript and the
          last word of the transcript to the audio file. For example, given a
          long audio clip with a short transcript, “full recording duration”
          refers only to the period between the first word and the last word
          of the transcript corresponding to the audio clip. However, you can
          make a selection outside a transcript duration and Drift will
          calculate Voxit prosodic measurements for that full selection
          duration, regardless whether a transcript is found in the selection.
